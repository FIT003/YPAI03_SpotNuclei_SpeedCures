# Spot Nuclei, Speed Cures

## Desription
In this project, we aim to spot nuclei in medical images using deep learning techniques. The project is based on the Kaggle competition "Data Science Bowl 2018." The goal is to develop an algorithm that can accurately segment nuclei in images of human cells. By automating this process, medical researchers can save time and effort, ultimately speeding up the discovery of cures for diseases.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project can be downloaded from the following link: [Dataset](https://shrdc-my.sharepoint.com/personal/kong_kah_chun_shrdc_org_my/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fkong_kah_chun_shrdc_org_my%2FDocuments%2FDeep%20Learning%20TTT%2FImage%20Segmentation%2FData%2Fdata-science-bowl-2018%2Ezip&parent=%2Fpersonal%2Fkong_kah_chun_shrdc_org_my%2FDocuments%2FDeep%20Learning%20TTT%2FImage%20Segmentation%2FData&ga=1
). It contains a set of images of human cells and their corresponding masks, which indicate the location of nuclei in the images.
